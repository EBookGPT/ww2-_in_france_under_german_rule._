This story is a textbook example of "telling" instead of "showing". It reads like a summary of events rather than a story that draws the reader in.  The dialogue is flat, devoid of personality or tension, and the characters feel like archetypes rather than individuals.  Here's a brutal, but hopefully constructive, critique:

**Overall:** 

* **Lack of Conflict:** The narrative feels static.  While we're told there's danger and oppression, we don't experience it.  The "conflict" is too broad: the occupation.  Show us specific conflicts, like a tense encounter with a German patrol, a difficult choice a character must make, or a moment of betrayal.
* **Weak Character Development:**  The characters are defined by broad strokes: "spirited young woman," "brooding silence," "pillar of strength."  Give us glimpses into their hopes, fears, flaws, and desires.  What makes Marie different from any other "spirited young woman"? What drives Pierre's silence?  What internal struggles does Madame Dubois face?
* **Uninspired Dialogue:** The dialogue is exposition-heavy and lacks natural flow.  Instead of telling us about the characters' anxieties, show us through their conversations. For example, "The scent of fear hung heavy in the air" could be shown through Marie's hushed voice as she speaks to her brother, or Pierre's nervous glances around the room. 
* **Over-reliance on Summary:**  The narrative constantly summarizes: "The villagers huddled inside their homes, their conversations hushed, their faces etched with worry."  Show us a scene of a family trying to eat dinner, the silence broken only by the clatter of cutlery.

**Specific Issues:**

* **The Informant:** This character is introduced but never developed. Who are they? What are their motives?  What makes them a "threat" beyond generic suspicion?
* **The German Officer:** This character is introduced as a potential point of conflict, but the encounter feels contrived and rushed.  What is it about the officer that draws Marie to him?  What is his internal conflict? How does this encounter affect their lives? 
* **The Collaborator:**  While we're told Monsieur Durand is a traitor, we don't see him manipulating the villagers.  Show us a scene where he spreads fear or deceit.
* **The Resistance:** The Resistance camp feels like a generic "good guys" location.  What makes this group unique? What are their individual goals? What challenges do they face within their own ranks?

**How to Improve:**

* **Focus on specific events:**  Instead of broadly describing the occupation, pick a single event and explore it in detail.  A raid on a German supply depot, a meeting with a resistance contact, a tense encounter with a collaborator.
* **Develop your characters:**  Give each character unique traits, flaws, and motivations. Show us their inner conflicts and how they react to the pressures of the occupation.
* **Show, don't tell:**  Instead of telling us about fear, show us a character trembling, a child crying, or a family huddled in silence.  Instead of saying someone is "spirited," show them defying orders or standing up for their beliefs.
* **Craft compelling dialogue:** Make your dialogue natural and reveal character. Use it to show tension, fear, love, or betrayal.  Instead of "The Germans are tightening their grip," have characters express their anxieties in a conversation. 

**Remember:**  A good dystopian story is more than just a setting.  It's about characters navigating a complex world, struggling with moral dilemmas, and ultimately finding hope in the face of oppression.  Give your characters the space to grow, your conflicts the room to breathe, and your dialogue the power to draw the reader into the story.
